# meson-wraps

This repository holds meson wraps used on pragtical that may be too big to
include directly on Pragtical source tree. Wraps can get outdated on the
mesonbuild wrapdb registry, so if possible we update them and host them to
reduce the time to delivery of project releases.

When time permits we may contribute back the updates to meson wrapdb.
